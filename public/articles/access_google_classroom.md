Gooogle Classroom is an online platform used to post assignments for your classes. Both teachers and students use it and find it convienient and easy to use.

## Accessing
To access Google Classroom, follow these steps:
1. Ensure you know your Colegia account information. (If you don't, please read the [Accessing Colegia](/article/access_colegia) article to learn about it and find your account.)
2. Navigate to [https://google.com/classroom](https://google.com/classroom) (tapping this link on a mobile device will open the app). It may ask you to sign in.
    * If you need to sign in, enter your Colegia email in the Email field. Click "Next." It will redirect you to Colegia where you will enter your username and password. You will be redirected back to Google Classroom once you successfully sign in.
3. You're in! 


### Notes
* There is an app for Google Classroom. This is highly recommended to have if you want notifications for due dates, new assignments, and announcements as well as easy access to everything Classroom has to offer. It is available on mobile for [iOS on the App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/google-classroom/id924620788) or [Android on the Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.classroom&hl=en_US&gl=US).

* At the beginning of the year, you were automatically added to a Classroom for each of your classes. You may "unenroll" from them if the class does not use Google Classroom (for example, Executive Internship or a D.E class). Select the three dots next to a class, then select "Unenroll" at the bottom of your screen or in the popup that appears. You can always join the class back at a later time with a code.

* You may join a Classroom at any time, by selecting the plus icon in the bottom right of your screen on mobile or the plus icon in the navigation bar on Desktop and entering the class code your teacher gives you.
