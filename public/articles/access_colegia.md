Colegia is a web portal that links most academic websites you will use in one place. It also provides you with an account that you need to access most services you will use for school. It is necessary to memorize your Colegia login information, as you use it to access nearly every online service that is required for school.

## Finding Your Account
1. Head to [https://colegia.org](https://colegia.org). Near the top of your screen or in a navigation menu, select "ColegiaID."
2. A form will appear. In the "County" field, find the option that says "St. Lucie." In the "Student ID Number" field, enter the 562#/ID number you memorized. If you don't know this number, please read the [Access Skyward](/article/access_skyward) article.
3. Submit the form. If the information was correct, your new Colegia email address will be displayed.
    * If you do not *have* a 562#, you should notify the office if you haven't already. In the meantime, you are basically a ghost as far as all technology is concerned.

## Using the Platform
* Once you have your Colegia login information, you are free to use Colegia however you need.

* *A future version of SCPATG includes links to many of the services that Colegia unnecessarily makes you login to access. Until this comes out, use Colegia to access Single Sign On (SSO) for things like Springboard and Vocabulary.com. Other services like Outlook and Google Classroom do not require that you go through the Colegia website.*
